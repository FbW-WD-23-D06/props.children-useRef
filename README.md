# children-useRef

## Branches:

- **props-children**: `props.children` is a special prop, automatically passed to every component. It can be used to render content passed from parent component.

  `useRef` hook returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

- **useRef-dom**: This example shows how to use `useRef` to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

  **react-bad-dom-manipulation**: understand why is bad manipulate the DOM using DOM selectors and not useRef

- **useRef-prev-value**: This example shows how to use it to store previous value of a prop or state.
